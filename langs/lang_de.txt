Not content to stay buried in their burrows in the sand, Crocs can be quite a nuisance, infesting this whole island. Tender Feet and Newbies are advised: Avoid touching these crawling red devils.

Now that I think about it, I have another task for you. I asked Resa from the light armor shop to craft me some new clothes, she is a bit far from here, I can't go there because I need to watch the dock.


Now that you bring up that topic, that reminds me of something...


Now wait your partner, and talk with me again


Now you divorced!

Oh gut! Hat er dir auch dein Geld zurückgegeben?

Oh hey!


Oh look, there's a piou behind you!
Oh schau, da ist ein Piou hinter dir!

Oh no, but I've noticed a weird light on the other edge of this island, I wonder what it can be...
Oh nein, aber ich habe ein seltsames Licht am anderen Rand der Insel bemerkt, und ich frage mich was es sein kann ...

Oh no, the piou escaped!


Oh no, you still have @@ Fluffies to kill.


Oh noes!


Oh oh... I see, your party became so big that you want to create an even larger structure?


Oh really? How could I forget something as important as that?!
Oh, wirklich? Wie konnte ich nur so etwas Wichtiges wie dies vergessen?!

Oh really? I'll put more food in the next box then.

Oh yeye did, his store is just beside me!


Oh yeyeye... As they are not edible, you can maybe try to equip them?#0


Oh yeyeye... As they are not edible, you can maybe try to equip them?#1


Oh! And in one of the rooms of the second deck you can find Gado's knives. Our chef keeps there the sharpest ones... Probably not just to cut some carrots...


Oh! And our party chat was really entertaining, I do highly recommend you to share this fun as well.


Oh! I like that sort of answer!
Oh! Mir gefällt diese Art der Antwort!

Oh! You saved me, I was too afraid to unpack my stuff without this pass.


Oh, I see. That's right. Why should someone come here to see me, seriously?


Oh, I was going to ask you if you wanted to help the crew search for some food and explore the island out there.


Oh, and I almost forgot! Do not give the password of your room to anybody! I am the only one who has the other key and I won't ask for yours so keep it secret and try not to use the same password for any other room in the future.


Oh, and Olga from the market place as well!
Ach ja, und Olga vom guten Marktplatz!

Oh, and a fruit may even fall for you if you are lucky! But stay alert to pick up your drops.
