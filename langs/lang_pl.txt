They are each valued individuals and I need them both. In the past, I probably made my share of mistakes. I regret good management is so difficult. I was wondering if you could investigate and... Sort out this situation.


They are fresh!


They are fresh, they are good!


They are married... wish them well.


They are so tasty when cooked with some @@. Don't drop any of them!


They shouldn't be too far from each other.

We are very lucky, my friend.


We arrived in Artis today.


We arrived this morning at the port of Artis, I already warned the Legion of Aemil concerning your issue.


We have made a stop at a little island, before making it on to the port of Artis.


We haven't met, right?


We hold various training sessions, and also have a task board with a heap of things to do for the city and its surroundings.


We just returned from a long journey and Artis is a good city to rest and to conclude our exchange.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.
Potrzebujemy jak najwięcej ludzi aby zbadać wyspę i zdobyć nową żywność.

We need manpower on the island.#1


We need manpower on the island... Oh forgive me, women are also welcome, of course.#0


We offer a room for travelers passing by Artis, our beds are comfy and you can be guaranted to be right as rain after a night here!


We offer party and guild certifications and we can also teach you how to use some basic communication skills.


We sell a brimmed hat, you can craft a feather card and attach it to this hat to obtain an enhanced version of it!


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the Legion of Aemil about what happened, I'm sure they can help.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.


We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly destroyed them. It's why we gave you these clothes. They're not very nice, but that's all that we have for you.#0
Chcieliśmy je uprać, ale woda morska je poniszczyła. Żebyś się nie pochorował to dostaniesz nowe. Piękne nie są, ale podziękuj że w ogóle je dostaniesz.#0

We usually dock around these small isles because they provide us some of the best food of all the archipelago.


We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the captain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!
Zazwyczaj nie zatrzymujemy się w takich miejscach, ale kapitan zezwolił na postój do czasu zanotowania pozycji tej nowej wyspy na swojej mapie!

We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.
Dobublamy się tam za parę dni i tam Cię wysadzimy.

We will talk about it later.#0

Well done! The ship is now ready to sail again!
Wspaniale! Statek jest gotowy do dalszej żeglugi!

Więc, jest coś w czym mogę pomóc ?

Well, it's not bad to finally feel something beneath my feet.
Cóż, nie jest źle, w końcu coś poczuć pod stopami.

Well, thanks for the box. But... He was supposed to bring it back to me himself. I never asked him to give it to you!
Więc,  dzięki za skrzynię. Ale ... on miał mi ją przynieść osobiście. Nie prosiłem go o to by dawał ją tobie!

Well... I don't think it is the best way to rule a ship. Think about it.
Więc... Nie sądzę, że to jest dobra droga do rządzenia statkiem. Pomyśl o tym.

Well... I've only killed some little pious in the ship, that's all.
Więc... Zabiłem tylko kilka piou na statku, to wszystko.

Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
Więc... Nie, czekaj, mam coś dla ciebie, ale nie powinieneś tego jeść... Zabieram to do kuchni.
