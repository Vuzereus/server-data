Not content to stay buried in their burrows in the sand, Crocs can be quite a nuisance, infesting this whole island. Tender Feet and Newbies are advised: Avoid touching these crawling red devils. They have huge, deadly claws that can make mincemeat of you! You can recognize them easily by their crabby personalities. Be careful younglings.

Now that I think about it, I have another task for you. I asked Resa from the light armor shop some new clothes, she is a bit far from here, I can't go there as I need to watch the dock.

Of course, as a fully-fledged crew member you can decide of the destination of La Johanne directly with Nard.


Of course, so why do I still see plain sea from the porthole?


Of course, they are on the left wall, go have a look at them.
É claro, eles estão na parede à esquerda, vá dar uma olhada.

Oh I see... Sailors are not able to do their job anymore, is it like that?!
Oh entendi... Marinheiros não são mais capazes de fazer o seu trabalho, é assim?

Oh alright, nevermind then.
Oh certo, então esqueça.

Oh and guess what, I'm soon out of potions anyway.


Oh darling, what brought you here?


Oh good! Did he give you your money back as well?
Oh bom! Ele também deu seu dinheiro de volta?

Oh hey!


Oh look, there's a piou behind you!
Oh olhe, há um Piou atrás de você!

Oh no, but I've noticed a weird light on the other edge of this island, I wonder what it can be...
Oh não, mas eu percebi uma luz estranha na outra ponta da ilha, me pergunto o que poderá ser aquilo...

Oh no, the piou escaped!


Oh no, you still have @@ Fluffies to kill.


Oh noes!


Oh really? How could I forget something as important as that?!
Oh sério? Como eu poderia me esquecer de algo tão importante?

Oh really? I'll put more food in the next box then.
Oh, sério? Então eu vou colocar mais comida na próxima caixa.

Oh sure I remember you.


Oh thank you so much!

Oh! I like that sort of answer!
Oh! Eu gosto deste tipo de resposta!

Oh! You saved me, I was too afraid to unpack my stuff without this pass.


Oh, I see. That's right. Why should someone come here to see me, seriously?
Oh, percebo. Está bem. Por que alguém viria aqui para me visitar, sério?

Oh, I was going to ask you if you wanted to help the crew search for some food and explore the island out there.
Oh, eu ia te perguntar se você queria ajudar a tripulação a procurar comida e a explorar a ilha lá fora.

Oh, and I almost forgot! Do not give the password of your room to anybody! I am the only one who has the other key and I won't ask for yours so keep it secret and try not to use the same password for any other room in the future.
Oh, e eu quase me esqueci! Não diga a senha de seu quarto para ninguém! Eu sou o único que tem a outra chave e eu não vou pedir a sua, portanto mantenha em segredo e tente não usar a mesma senha para outros quartos no futuro.

Oh, and Olga from the market place as well!
Oh, e a Olga do mercado também!

On one hand, ranged weapons are generally weaker than melee ones, but you attack from a safer position. On the other hand, depending on the level of the weapon, melee ones potentially can yeild quicker kills.

We are very lucky, my friend.


We arrived this morning at the port of Artis, I already warned the Legion of Aemil concerning your issue.


We arrived to Artis today.


We didn't meet, right?


We have made a stop at a little island, before making it on to the port of Artis.


We have various training sessions, and also a board with open tasks for the city and its surroundings.


We just returned from a long journey and Artis is a good city to rest and to conclude our exchange.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.
Nós precisamos do maior número possível de pessoas para explorar a ilha e para pegar comida.

We need manpower on the island.#1

We offer a room for travelers passing by Artis, our beds are comfy and you can be guaranted to be right as rain after a night here!


We offer different kind of training sessions and we have a board with open tasks for the city and its surrounding.


We sell a brimmed hat, you can craft a feather card and attach it to this hat to obtain an enhanced version of it!


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the Legion of Aemil about what happened, I'm sure they can help.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.


We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly destroyed them. It's why we gave you these clothes. They're not very nice, but that's all that we have for you.#0
Nós tentamos limpar suas roupas mas a água salgada as destruiu. Por isso nós te demos essas roupas novas. Elas não são muito legais, mas isso é tudo que temos para você.

We usually dock around these small isles because they provide us some of the best food of all the archipelago.


We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the captain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!
Normalmente nós não paramos em lugares tão esplêndidos, mas o capitão nos deixou ficar aqui enquanto ele escreve a localização desta nova ilha no mapa.

We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.

Bem, obrigado pela caixa. Mas... Ele tinha que trazê-las para mim ele mesmo. Eu nunca pedi para ele dá-las para você!

Well... I don't think it is the best way to rule a ship. Think about it.
Bem... Eu não acho que este é o melhor modo de comandar um barco.  Pense sobre isso.

Well... I've only killed some little pious in the ship, that's all.
Bem... Eu apenas matei alguns pequenos pious no navio, só isso.

Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
Bem... Espere, eu tenho algo para você mas você não deveria comer... Eu vou levar de volta à cozinha.
