He asked to lend some money and a place to open his store, I think that he asked for a place on the merchant squares on the south-west of the city...


He did not change while growing up, I repeatedly asked him to leave the forge but in the end he installed himself in front of it...


He has a guns!


He is eating an apple, thoroughly enjoying it.


He is in a small house between the dock's warehouse and the dojo.


He is mature and he rarely ask questions so I am fine. I can not stand the sight of a whiner anyway.


He is probably hiding up one of the trees. Go close to each tree and look up, otherwise you won't notice him.


He is very lucky that Don took him under his wing, but being the student of such a teacher is not easy every day!


He likes to hide near the little lake in the north-west side of the island.
Gli piace nascondersi vicino ad un piccolo laghetto nel versante Nord-Ovest dell'isola.

He may not have all of his wits but keep in mind one thing:


He needs more food.

It's a kind of mushroom. We call it like that because of it's taste, just like a marshmallow. It also has this name because of it's appearance, it looks like a plush!
E' un tipo di fungo. Lo chiamiamo cosi' per via del suo sapore, simile al marshmallow. Il suo nome deriva anche dal suo aspetto cosi' simile ad un morbido tessuto.

We have a special room for this purpose, too. You may test your skills against all kinds of dreadful monsters in there.


We have made a stop at a little island, before making it on to the port of Artis.


We haven't met, right?


We hold various training sessions, and also have a task board with a heap of things to do for the city and its surroundings.


We just returned from a long journey and Artis is a good city to rest and to conclude our exchange.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.
Ci servono più mani possibile per esplorare l'isola, e trovare del cibo.

We sell a brimmed hat, you can craft a feather card and attach it to this hat to obtain an enhanced version of it!


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the Legion of Aemil about what happened, I'm sure they can help.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.

We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the captain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!
Generalmente non ci fermiamo in questi posti, ma questa volta il capitano ci ha lasciato sbarcare mentre traccia la posizione di quest'isola sulla sua mappa!

E' una bella sensazione avere finalmente qualcosa sotto i piedi.

Well, thanks for the box. But... He was supposed to bring it back to me himself. I never asked him to give it to you!
Be', grazie per la cassa. Ma... doveva essere lui a riportarmela. Non gli ho mai chiesto di darla a te!

Well... I don't think it is the best way to rule a ship. Think about it.
Be... Non credo sia il modo migliore per governare una nave.

Well... I've only killed some little pious in the ship, that's all.
Be'... Ho solo combattoto con i Piou della nave. Tutto qui.

Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
No aspetta! Ho qualcosa per te ma e' meglio che non la mangi... La riporto in cucina.
