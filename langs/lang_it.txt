E dopo cos'e' successo?

And to demonstrate his beautiful voice,
E mettere in mostra la sua bella voce.

And tried to attract him thus.

And what would you give me in exchange for that information?

E quando avremo abbastanza sodi per noi senza aver bisogno di nessun altro.

And where can I find these potions?
E dove posso trovare queste pozioni?

And with my piou. That's wonderful. I can only imagine how hard that little bugger was to catch!
E con il mio Piou. È fantastico. Posso solo immaginare quanto sia stato difficile acchiappare quella piccola peste!

But be careful: do not scream by using a lot of capital letters, do not repeat yourself over and over, and above all DO NOT SPAM, or you may be severely penalized.


But discovering new territories is probably the best thing that can happen to sailors, don't you think?
Ma scoprire nuove terre è probabilmente la miglior cosa che possa capitare ad un marinaio, non pensi?

But don't you worry! I don't know how to get you back your memories, but we can work on your muscles for now!
Ma non preoccuparti! Non so come renderti la memoria, ma possiamo lavorare sui tuoi muscoli perora!

But for now, you can relax on the ship, or visit the island we're docked at! Its a small island, but a good place to get some exercise and stretch your legs.
Ma per ora, puoi rilassarti sulla nave, o visitare l'isola la fuori! È una piccola isola, ma un buon posto per fare esercizio e sgranchirti le gambe. 

But he just told me to leave him alone.


But he never returned.
Ma non è mai più tornato.

But hey, back to me. Remember my mentioning that I'm hun...grrr...eee!
Ma hey, torna qui. Ricordi che stavo dicendo di essere affamaaaaaatooooo!

But how I got there is kind of scary...


But if you and other players surrounds the monster instead, they'll suffer the same penalties!


But if you fail, you will have to get them from the alchemist.
Ma se fallisci, dovrai procurarteli dall'alchimista.

But if you need to deal with more burocratic stuff, go talk to Q'Anon. He is the boss here.


But if you really want to accomplish something, you should consider joining us.
Ma se davvero vuoi conlcudere qualcosa, dovresti prendere in considerazione l'idea di unirti a noi.

But if you tell my sister, that you didn't find me, I can stay here all day, eating apples and enjoying the view.
Ma se dici a mia sorella che non mi hai trovato, posso stare qui tutto il giorno a mangiare mele e godermi il panorama.

But in the future I might be able to help you create some of your own.
Ma in futuro potrei aiutarti a crearne di tuoi.

But let's talk about this island. We're docking here to find some fine quality goods.
Ma parliamo piuttosto di quest'isola. Siamo approdati qui per fare scorta di cibo genuino.

But my luck left me, because as soon as I left his house, the guards started chasing me.
Ma la fortuna mi ha abbandonato, perchè non appena lasciata questa casa, i gendarmi hanno iniziato a braccarmi.

But rare are those that receive grants from the Legion itself. For anybody else only a hard work can pay your bills!
Ma sono rari coloro che ricevono denari dalla Legione stessa. Tutti gli altri devono ricorrere al duro lavoro per sopravvivere!

But remember that not every place in this world is peaceful and safe nowadays. Even the white shores you are walking on can hide some dangerous beings.
Ma ricordati che non tutti i posti di questa terra sono sicuri al giorno d'oggi. Anche le bianche spiagge su cui ti trovi possono celare creature pericolose.

But since it's not dummies that will go after you out there, this training won't be enough.
Ma dato che non saranno dei manichini a braccart lì fuori, questo allenamento non sarà sufficiente.

But something like “Nanaj princino”, I think.


But still, you open your eyes and see a large ship before you!
Tuttavia apri gli occhi, e vedi una grande nave davanti a te!

But thank you anyway! I can refund him now!
Ma grazie comunque! Posso rimborsarlo ora!

But the last time I asked him for a new delivery he said that he would never again get any for me.

He asked to lend some money and a place to open his store, I think that he asked for a place on the merchant squares on the south-west of the city...
Ha chiesto del denaro in prestito e un posto per aprire il suo negozio, penso abbia chiesto un locale nella piazza dei mercanti, a sud-ovest della città...

He did not change while growing up, I repeatedly asked him to leave the forge but in the end he installed himself in front of it...


He has a guns!


He has never been the same since mommy went away...


He is a regular at the inn, located in the north-west part of town.


He is eating an apple, thoroughly enjoying it.


He is in a small house between the dock's warehouse and the dojo.


He is mature and he rarely ask questions so I am fine. I can not stand the sight of a whiner anyway.


He is probably hiding up one of the trees. Go close to each tree and look up, otherwise you won't notice him.
Probabilmente si sta nascondendo in cima a qualcuno di quegli alberi. Avvicinati ad ogni albero e cercalo in cima altrimenti potresti non notarlo. 

He is the greatest hero that ever walked the land of Hurnscald!


He is usually in his office on the 3rd floor.


He is very lucky that Don took him under his wing, but being the student of such a teacher is not easy every day!


He likes to eat sandwiches. A good thing they are so easy to make!


He likes to hide near the little lake in the north-west side of the island.
Gli piace nascondersi vicino ad un piccolo laghetto nel versante Nord-Ovest dell'isola.

He looks up and into your face.


He may not have all of his wits but keep in mind one thing:


He needs more food.
Ha bisogno di piu' cibo.

He opened his mouth wide and let drop his prey.


He proceeds to further scrutinize the log.


He said he is going to climb the highest hill in Artis, which is not far from here.
Ha detto che sarebbe andato ad arrampicarsi sulla collina più alta di Artis, che non è lontana da qui.

He said that he would check why weird noises were coming from the manhole next to the house.


He takes another sip.


He told me nothing about that.
Non mi ha detto niente.

He was heading north.


He's funny, it's not a problem.
È divertente, non è un problema.

He's holding a fishing rod, while gazing out at the sea.
Regge una canna da pesca, mentre scruta il mare.

Hear me *hic* well, what ever, whatididever you will *hic* said ab... uhm... out what?! You saw there, the Legion of Aemil won't let it get public.

Hehe, no. But I'm sure a noob like you would like to meet an idol like me.#1
Hehe, no. Ma sono sicuro un pivello come te avrebbe piacere a incontrare un mito come me.

Hehe, sometimes he gets his head in the clouds, You should go ask him about that.
Hehe, a volte ha la testa tra le nuvole. Dovresti chiedere a lui.

Hehe... Ok, I'm going to inform the capt'n up there.
Hehe... Va bene, andro' su ad informare il capitano.

Hehehe, he is a bit nervous, please forgive him, it is not everyday we have a new member in the crew!
Hehehe, e' un po' nervoso, ti prego di perdonarlo, non abbiamo nuovi membri dell'equipaggio ogni giorno!

Oh no, the piou escaped!

Oh! And our party chat was really entertaining, I do highly recommend you to share this fun as well.


Oh! I like that sort of answer!

On March 213CCE, Chancellor Benjamin Frost, with support of the council, proclaimed the Republic of Ancea. This event would become known as the Blue Revolution.


On a side note, more defense is always good, but the damage won't decrease on the same rate that defense raises.


On one hand, ranged weapons are generally weaker than melee ones, but you attack from a safer position. On the other hand, depending on the level of the weapon, melee ones potentially can yeild quicker kills.
Da una parte le armi a distanza sono generalmente piu' deboli di quelle da corpo a corpo, ma puoi attaccare da una distanza di sicurezza. D'altro canto le armi corpo a corpo, a seconda del loro livello, possono portare a una vittoria più rapida.

On the year 206CCE, after a long crisis of succession, a minor noble only known as Queen Platyna the Red came to inherit the Platinum Crown.


Once the monster is dead, click on the dropped items to add them to your inventory. You can also use the 'Z' key to claim the drops.
Una volta che il nemico muore, clicca col mouse sugli oggetti che ha lasciato cadere per aggiungerli al tuo inventario. Puoi anche usare il tasto 'Z' della tastiera per raccoglierli piu' velocemente.

Once used, they will disappear from your inventory.

One advice: Don't take the things those drinkers say too serious. They are sitting here and drinking all day.


One last thing to keep in mind... If you are surrounded, you'll suffer an agility and defense penalty.

Right over there.


Right! Ours is an earthsea realm. You see, sailors are swift at their tasks when out of sight of land, but docked by this verdant jewel, they have it so good, they are just taking too much time bringing all the food back to the ship. Maybe you can help them.
Ottima risposta! Il nostro è un regno terracqueo. Vedi, i marinai sono rapidissimi nei loro compiti quando la terra è fuori dalla vista, ma una volta approdati in questo paradiso terrestre, se la stanno passando così bene che ci stanno mettendo un'eternità a riportare il cibo raccolto sulla nave. Magari pui dar loro una mano.

Secondly, choose wisely which weapon is suited for you. Some people like to face their enemies closely with a heavy axe, others prefer to attack from a distance with a bow for example.
La seconda, è scegliere saggiamente l'arma che piu' ti si addice. Alcuni preferiscono affrontare i nemici da vicino con un'ascia pesante, altri preferiscono attaccare da lontano con l'arco.

Così nella fretta ho dimenticato di prendere abbastanza esche!

So it seems I have another stomach to fill. Those bastards have no respect for who feeds them every damn day!
Cosi' sembra che abbiamo un altro stomaco da riempire. Questi bastardi non hanno rispetto per chi gli da' da mangiare ogni gorno.

So my wife said that I should go and see the witch, just in case she knows something.


So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe he comes from that guild, as that sign was on his raft.#1
Ecco perché abbiamo voluto avvertirti, magari viene da quella gilda, quel simbolo era sulla sua zattera.

So the next day another witch shows up.


So you beat the monster? Then why are you so scared?


So you have now a pet, who is loyal to you. It'll follow you everywhere, but there are two things you must know.


So you think you're tough? A warrior must also be loyal and patient.

So, how do you feel? I see that Julia did a marvelous job! You look like you're in good health now.
Quindi, come ti senti? Vedo che Julia ha fatto un lavoro fantastico! Sembri quasi in buona salute.

So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?
Allora, come va? Hai incontrato altri membri dell'equipaggio?

So, search for answers.
Perciò, cerca le risposte.

So, what can I do for you?
Quindi, cosa posso fare per te?

So, what do you say?


So, what good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet me? Or is it because you've heard of my feats in Artis?#0
Quindi qual buon vento ti porta qui? Eri sulla zattera per incontrarmi? O perche' avevi sentito dei miei famosi banchetti ad Artis?

So, what was I saying?
Quindi, cosa stavo dicendo?

So, where is my piou? You should not keep an old man waiting. Go and catch it like you said you would.


So, you finally woke up? We all thought you were in something like... You know, one of these long comas.#0
Quindi finalmente ti sei svegliata? Tutti pensavamo tu fossi in un qualcosa simile a un... Hai presente, un lungo coma.

We have made a stop at a little island, before making it on to the port of Artis.
Abbiamo fatto scalo in un'isoletta prima di approdare al porto di Artis.

We haven't met, right?


We hold various training sessions, and also have a task board with a heap of things to do for the city and its surroundings.


We just returned from a long journey and Artis is a good city to rest and to conclude our exchange.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.
Ci servono più mani possibile per esplorare l'isola, e trovare del cibo.

We need manpower on the island.#1
Abbiamo bisogno di forza lavoro sull'isola.

We need manpower on the island... Oh forgive me, women are also welcome, of course.#0
Abbiamo bisogno di forzalavoro sull'isola... Anche le donne sono ovviamente benvenute.

We need to get out of here soon. I'm scared of the Slimes!


We offer a room for travelers passing by Artis, our beds are comfy and you can be guaranteed to be right as rain after a night here!


We offer party and guild certifications and we can also teach you how to use some basic communication skills.


We refuse service to anyone who:


We sell a brimmed hat, you can craft a feather card and attach it to this hat to obtain an enhanced version of it!


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the Legion of Aemil about what happened, I'm sure they can help.
Dovremmo essere lì in qualche giorno, avviserò la Legione di Aemil su ciò che è successo, sono sicuro che potrà essere d'aiuto.

We still don't know who did it.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.
Abbiamo pensato che tu avresti potuto aiutarci a capire, tutto ciò che sappiamo  è che ti abbiamo trovato disperso in mare, alla deriva nella tua zattera.

We thought we heard someone go down to the basement, but we checked the whole place over and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.


We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly destroyed them. It's why we gave you these clothes. They're not very nice, but that's all that we have for you.#0
Abbiamo provato a ripulirli ma l'acqua marina li ha rovinati irreparabilmente. Ecco perche' ti abbiamo rifornito di nuovi vestiti puliti. Non sono certo eleganti, ma e' tutto quello che abbiamo da darti.

Abbiamo provato a ripulirli ma l'acqua marina li ha praticamente distrutti. Ecco perchè ti abbiamo fornito dei nuovi vestiti. Non sono particolarmente accattivanti, ma e' tutto quello che ti possiamo dare.

We usually dock around these small isles because they provide us some of the best food of all the archipelago.
Generalmente facciamo scalo su queste isolette perchè ci offrono alcuni dei migliori cibi di tutto l'arcipelago.

We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the captain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!
Generalmente non ci fermiamo in questi posti, ma questa volta il capitano ci ha lasciato sbarcare mentre traccia la posizione di quest'isola sulla sua mappa!

We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.
Yayeremo li in pochi giorni e ti lascietemo lí.

We will talk about it later.


We'll be staying here in Tulimshar for a while.


We're doing different shows here.


We're soon leaving that island, please return to your cabine.


Weather Flags: 


Weather effects will disappear after teleporting or refreshing.

Well done! The ship is now ready to sail again!
Ben fatto! La nave è ora pronta per salpare di nuovo!

Well if you are whining like that all the time, then I think there is a reason behind their choice.
Se sei sempre cosi' lamentoso allora chredo che ci sia un motivo sietro la loro scelta.

Well in fact...


Well then... Take this one!
Va bene allora... Prendi questa cassa!

Well, I can't offer you much.


Well, I was exhausted and had to rest.


Well, I was in fact looking for them. Where are they now?
A dir la verita' li stavo proprio cercando. Sai dove sono ora?

Well, I'm done for the day, and I'm quite old enough to decide when I can have a %s, thank you!


Well, cooking is an art, and thus, you need intelligence and dexterity to learn.

Bene, c'e' qualcosa che posso fare per aiutare?

Well, it's not bad to finally feel something beneath my feet.
E' una bella sensazione avere finalmente qualcosa sotto i piedi.

Well, of course, I can show you how to cook sandwiches. But you'll need to bring ingredients for practice.


Well, of course. First of all, you need a @@. You can have mine, if you want.


Well, thanks for the box. But... He was supposed to bring it back to me himself. I never asked him to give it to you!
Be', grazie per la cassa. Ma... doveva essere lui a riportarmela. Non gli ho mai chiesto di darla a te!

Well... I don't think it is the best way to rule a ship. Think about it.
Be... Non credo sia il modo migliore per governare una nave.

Well... I've only killed some little pious in the ship, that's all.
Be'... Ho solo combattoto con i Piou della nave. Tutto qui.

Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
No aspetta! Ho qualcosa per te ma e' meglio che non la mangi... La riporto in cucina.

With hunger, thirst, and sleep as your only companions, you have the disturbing realization that you can't remember anything of your former life or identity.
Mentre hai la fame, la sete ed il sonno come unici compagni, realizzi con terrore che non ricordi nulla nè della tua precedente vita, nè della tua identità. 

With it, you can safely move items and funds between your characters.
Così puoi spostare oggetti e denaro tra i tuoi personaggi in tutta sicurezza.

With the growth of the Kingdom halted, slow maintenance, and two great famines which killed over half the human population, the council decided to seize power and depose Platyna the Red.


With the help of the town hall and the Legion of Aemil we organize some auction and we help local merchants to launch their businesses.
Con l'aiuto del Municipio e della legione di Aemil organizziamo delle aste e diamo una mano ai mercanti locali nell'avviare la loro attività.

Within the cities is a place safe enough not to be attacked by another person (except during wars). But outside of them there are some places where the citizen can be attacked by enemies from other realms, or even by someone from the same realm.
