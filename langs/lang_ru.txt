As you may know, we are explorers on a long distance voyage, and our swashbuckling mariners need to store enough food to survive. You don't know how dangerous the sea life can be.
Как ты, возможно, понял, мы — исследователи, совершающие дальние плавания, и наши удалые моряки должны запасти достаточно продовольствия, чтобы выжить. Ты не представляешь, насколько опасна жизнь моряка.

But all she says is, “had you stayed inside, you wouldn't be wet now”.


But anyway, take the road which goes to the north to find everybody.
Но, в любом случае, возьми путь на север, чтобы найти всех.

But be careful: do not scream by using a lot of capital letters, do not repeat yourself over and over, and above all DO NOT SPAM, or you may be severely penalized.


But discovering new territories is probably the best thing that can happen to sailors, don't you think?


But don't you worry! I don't know how to get you back your memories, but we can work on your muscles for now!


But for now, you can relax on the ship, or visit the island we're docked at! Its a small island, but a good place to get some exercise and stretch your legs.
Сейчас ты можешь отдохнуть на корабле или посетить остров, к которому мы причалили! Этот остров маленький, однако отличное место, чтобы поупражняться и размять твои ноги.

But hey, back to me. Remember my mentioning that I'm hun...grrr...eee!
Эй, обернись ко мне. Не забудь: я гоо...лоо...деен!

But how I got there is kind of scary...


But if you and other players surrounds the monster instead, they'll suffer the same penalties!


But if you fail, you will have to get them from the alchemist.
Но если проиграешь, тогда пойдёшь за ними к алхимику.

But if you need to deal with more burocratic stuff, go talk to Q'Anon. He is the boss here.


But if you really want to accomplish something, you should consider joining us.


But if you tell my sister, that you didn't find me, I can stay here all day, eating apples and enjoying the view.
Однако, если скажешь моей сестре, что не нашёл меня, я смогу оставаться здесь весь день, сть яблоки и наслаждаться видом.

But in the future I might be able to help you create some of your own.


But let's talk about this island. We're docking here to find some fine quality goods.
Но давай поговорим об этом острове. Мы пришвартовались здесь, чтобы найти немного хороших товаров.

But my luck left me, because as soon as I left his house, the guards started chasing me.
Однако удача покинула меня, как только я вылез из его дома, за мной погнались стражники.

But rare are those that receive grants from the Legion itself. For anybody else only a hard work can pay your bills!
Лишь немногие получают пособия от самого Легиона. Все остальные должны работать в поте лица, что бы оплатить счета!

But remember that not every place in this world is peaceful and safe nowadays. Even the white shores you are walking on can hide some dangerous beings.
Но запомни, что не каждое место в мире мирное и безопасное в наши дни. Даже белые берега, по которым ты ходишь, могут скрывать в себе опасных созданий.

But since it's not dummies that will go after you out there, this training won't be enough.


But something like “Nanaj princino”, I think.


But still, you open your eyes and see a large ship before you!


But thank you anyway! I can refund him now!

He asked to lend some money and a place to open his store, I think that he asked for a place on the merchant squares on the south-west of the city...


He did not change while growing up, I repeatedly asked him to leave the forge but in the end he installed himself in front of it...


He has a guns!


He has never been the same since mommy went away...


He is a regular at the inn, located in the north-west part of town.


He is eating an apple, thoroughly enjoying it.


He is in a small house between the dock's warehouse and the dojo.


He is mature and he rarely ask questions so I am fine. I can not stand the sight of a whiner anyway.


He is probably hiding up one of the trees. Go close to each tree and look up, otherwise you won't notice him.


He is the greatest hero that ever walked the land of Hurnscald!


He is usually in his office on the 3rd floor.


He is very lucky that Don took him under his wing, but being the student of such a teacher is not easy every day!


He likes to eat sandwiches. A good thing they are so easy to make!


He likes to hide near the little lake in the north-west side of the island.
Он любит прятаться около маленького озера в северо-западной стороне острова.

He looks up and into your face.


He may not have all of his wits but keep in mind one thing:


He needs more food.

He opened his mouth wide and let drop his prey.


He proceeds to further scrutinize the log.


He said he is going to climb the highest hill in Artis, which is not far from here.


He said that he would check why weird noises were coming from the manhole next to the house.


He takes another sip.


He told me nothing about that.

On March 213CCE, Chancellor Benjamin Frost, with support of the council, proclaimed the Republic of Ancea. This event would become known as the Blue Revolution.


On a side note, more defense is always good, but the damage won't decrease on the same rate that defense raises.


On one hand, ranged weapons are generally weaker than melee ones, but you attack from a safer position. On the other hand, depending on the level of the weapon, melee ones potentially can yeild quicker kills.
С одной стороны оружие дальнего боя обычно слабее, чем ближнего, за то ты атакуешь с более безопасной позиции. С другой стороны, в зависимости от уровня оружия, оружие ближнего боя потенциально убивает быстрее.

On the year 206CCE, after a long crisis of succession, a minor noble only known as Queen Platyna the Red came to inherit the Platinum Crown.


Once the monster is dead, click on the dropped items to add them to your inventory. You can also use the 'Z' key to claim the drops.
Когда монстр умрёт, выпадет предмет. Чтобы добавить его в инвентарь - кликните на нём. Вы так же можете использовать клавишу "Z", чтобы подобрать выпавшие предметы.

Right! Ours is an earthsea realm. You see, sailors are swift at their tasks when out of sight of land, but docked by this verdant jewel, they have it so good, they are just taking too much time bringing all the food back to the ship. Maybe you can help them.
Правильно! Наша область: земноморье. Ты видишь, моряки быстро справляются со своей работой, пока на горизонте нет земли, однако пришвартовавшись к этой зеленой драгоценности, они так радуются, что доставка продовольствия на корабль занимает у них слишком много времени. Может быть, ты сможешь им помочь.

So I go inside.


So I rush out, my wife telling me to leave the witch alone, and I see her standing there in the middle of the rain...


So I was going to ask if maybe you would be interested in giving me a hand with a few errands.#0

So close!


So finally someone has came to visit me?
Кто-то, наконец-то, пришел навестить меня?

So in a hurry, I forgot to take enough bait for fishing.


So it seems I have another stomach to fill. Those bastards have no respect for who feeds them every damn day!
Кажется, у меня появился ещё один пустой желудок. Эти ублюдки не уважают того, кто кормит их каждый чёртов день!

So my wife said that I should go and see the witch, just in case she knows something.


So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe he comes from that guild, as that sign was on his raft.#1
Вот почему мы хотели предупредить тебя, возможно он из той гильдии, знак которой был на плоту.

So that's why we wanted to warn you, maybe she comes from that guild, as that sign was on her raft.#0
Вот почему мы хотели предупредить тебя, возможно она из той гильдии, знак которой был на плоту.

So the next day another witch shows up.


So you beat the monster? Then why are you so scared?


So you have now a pet, who is loyal to you. It'll follow you everywhere, but there are two things you must know.


So you think you're tough? A warrior must also be loyal and patient.


So you think you're tough? A warrior must also be loyal and patient.#0


So you think you're tough? A warrior must also be loyal and patient.#1


So you're under the control of a dictatorship? That's... reassuring!


So, I guess you aren't chopping down trees anymore?


So, did you get your blood boiling? Give the dummies a good lesson? Good!#0


So, did you get your blood boiling? Give the dummies a good lesson? Good!#1


So, do you have anything for me today?
И так, у тебя есть что-то для меня?

So, do you still want a cookie?


So, everything went fine?


So, finally, we are here.


So, how do you feel? I see that Julia did a marvelous job! You look like you're in good health now.
Ну, как ты себя чувствуешь? Джулия чудесно над тобой поработала! Сейчас ты выглядишь здоровым.

So, how is it going? Did you meet any other crew members yet?
Как у тебя дела? Ты встретился с кем-нибудь из команды кроме меня?

So, search for answers.


So, what can I do for you?
Так что я могу сделать для тебя?

So, what do you say?


So, what good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet me? Or is it because you've heard of my feats in Artis?#0


So, what good wind brought you here? Were you on your raft to meet my Julia? Or is it because you wanted to see the beautiful waitresses of Artis?#1


So, what was I saying?
Так что я говорил?

So, where is my piou? You should not keep an old man waiting. Go and catch it like you said you would.


So, you finally woke up? We all thought you were in something like... You know, one of these long comas.#0
Так ты наконец проснулась? Мы думали ты была в чём то вроде... Знаешь, такие затяжные комы.

Some of your items cannot be vended and were removed from the shop.


Some others also like to buy them to keep as trophies. Either way, you can make some money with that.


Some people prefer to catch fish using magic, but calling that "fishing" would be an insult to this traditional sport.


Some people, however, prefer to fish with more unorthodox baits, such as @@ or @@.


Some special items cannot be traded, discarded, nor sold. With a right click, you can also protect normal items as if they were special ones.


Some tasks will help you become aquainted with Artis. Trust me.


Some types of fish also enjoy @@ quite a bit.


Some, but not all, from the rare or non-replaceable items will have a warning when you try to sell them.


Somebody is probably training, better wait for him to finish.


Somebody is waiting for you outside!
Кое-кто ждет тебя снаружи!

Somebody took your place on this spot!


Somebody tried to stroke the word "fish" and tried to replace it with "sharkes".


Somehow you don't feel good about your deed.


Someone in a theater mask, eh?


Something else?


Something is wrong with me, I can't smile nor sit.

We arrived in Artis today.


We arrived this morning at the port of Artis, I already warned the Legion of Aemil concerning your issue.


We don't need it anymore.


We follow north hemisphere seasons in case you're wondering.


We have a special room for this purpose, too. You may test your skills against all kinds of dreadful monsters in there.


We have made a stop at a little island, before making it on to the port of Artis.
Мы остановились на небольшом острове, прежде чем отправиться в порт Артиса.

We haven't met, right?


We hold various training sessions, and also have a task board with a heap of things to do for the city and its surroundings.


We just returned from a long journey and Artis is a good city to rest and to conclude our exchange.


We need as many hands as possible to explore the island out there, and to get some new food.
Нам нужно как можно больше рук, чтобы исследовать здешний остров и заготовить новой еды.

We need manpower on the island.#1
Нам нужна мужская сила на острове.

We need manpower on the island... Oh forgive me, women are also welcome, of course.#0
Нам нужна мужская сила на острове... О, прости, женщинам мы тоже всегда рады.

We need to get out of here soon. I'm scared of the Slimes!


We offer a room for travelers passing by Artis, our beds are comfy and you can be guaranteed to be right as rain after a night here!


We offer party and guild certifications and we can also teach you how to use some basic communication skills.


We refuse service to anyone who:


We sell a brimmed hat, you can craft a feather card and attach it to this hat to obtain an enhanced version of it!


We should be there in a few days, once we arrive, I will warn the Legion of Aemil about what happened, I'm sure they can help.


We still don't know who did it.


We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.
Мы думали, что ты поможешь нам разобраться, всё, что мы знаем, это то, что мы нашли тебя брошенным в море, дрейфующим на своём плоту.

We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.#1


We thought we heard someone go down to the basement, but we checked the whole place over and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.


We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly destroyed them. It's why we gave you these clothes. They're not very nice, but that's all that we have for you.#0
Мы пытались почистить их, но морская вода их практически уничтожила. Поэтому мы дали тебе эти вещи. Они не очень хорошие, но это все что у нас есть для тебя.

Мы пытались почистить их, но морская вода их практически уничтожила. Поэтому мы дали тебе эти вещи. Они не очень хорошие, но это все что у нас есть для тебя.

We usually dock around these small isles because they provide us some of the best food of all the archipelago.
Обычно мы пришвартовываемся к одному из этих маленьких островов, так как они снабжают нас самыми лучшими припасами на всём архипелаге.

We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the captain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!
Обычно, мы не останавливаемся в таких прекрасных местах, но капитан разрешил нам остаться здесь на время, пока он наносит местоположение этого нового острова на карту!

We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.
Мы прибудем туда в течение нескольких дней, высадим тебя там.

We will talk about it later.


We'll be staying here in Tulimshar for a while.


We're doing different shows here.


We're soon leaving that island, please return to your cabine.

Ну, это не плохо, наконец-то чувствовать что-то под ногами.

Well, of course, I can show you how to cook sandwiches. But you'll need to bring ingredients for practice.


Well, of course. First of all, you need a @@. You can have mine, if you want.


Well, thanks for the box. But... He was supposed to bring it back to me himself. I never asked him to give it to you!
Ну, спасибо за ящик. Но... Он должен был сам принести мне его. Я вообще не просил его давать это тебе!

Well... I don't think it is the best way to rule a ship. Think about it.
Ну... Я не думаю, что это лучший способ управления кораблём. Подумай об этом.

Well... I've only killed some little pious in the ship, that's all.
Ну... Я всего лишь убил несколько маленьких пию на корабле. И всё.

Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
Ну так... Нет, стоп. У меня есть кое что для тебя, но ты не должна это есть... Я отнесу это обратно на кухню.

With the growth of the Kingdom halted, slow maintenance, and two great famines which killed over half the human population, the council decided to seize power and depose Platyna the Red.


With the help of the town hall and the Legion of Aemil we organize some auction and we help local merchants to launch their businesses.


Withdraw.


Within the cities is a place safe enough not to be attacked by another person (except during wars). But outside of them there are some places where the citizen can be attacked by enemies from other realms, or even by someone from the same realm.
