I will not lie to a little girl! And your mother needs your help


I will not tell you all the details, but after a month, she was ruling the ship and I was sent down here, cooking for those traitors!
No t'explicaré tots els detalls, però després d'un mes, ella estava governant el vaixell i jo vaig ser enviat aquí baix, per a cuinar per aquests traïdors!

I will send you this letter directly when I arrive


I will surely visit him. Do you need any help with your boxes?
El visitaré, es clar. Necessites alguna ajuda amb les teves caixes?

I will take care of the other ones don't worry.
Tindré cura dels altres no et preocupis.

We thought that you could help us understand this, all we know is that we found you cast in the sea, adrift on your raft.


We tried to clean them but the sea water mostly destroyed them. It's why we gave you these clothes. They're not very nice, but that's all that we have for you.#0
Hem provat de rentar-la, però l'aigua de mar l'a destruït en gran part.Es per això que t'hem donat aquesta roba. No es gaire bonica, però es tot el que et podem oferir.#0

We usually dock around these small isles because they provide us some of the best food of all the archipelago.
Normalment atraquem a aquests petits trossos de terra, ja que ens proveeixen d'alguns del millors menjars de tot l'arxipèlag.

We usually don't stop in such splendid places, but the captain let us stay here while he writes down the location of this new island on his map!
Normalment no ens aturem en aquests meravellosos llocs, però el capità ens deixa estar aquí mentre escriu la localització d'aquesta nova illa al mapa!

We will be yaying there in a few days, so we will drop you off there.
Nosaltres estarem yaying allí en uns quants dies, així que et deixarem allí.

We're soon leaving that island, please return to your cabine.

Well, thanks for the box. But... He was supposed to bring it back to me himself. I never asked him to give it to you!
Bé, gràcies per la capsa. Però... Es suposava que me l'havia de portar ell mateix. No li he dit en cap moment que te la dones a tu!

Well... I don't think it is the best way to rule a ship. Think about it.
Bé ... No crec que sigui la millor manera de portar un vaixell. Pensa-hi. 

Well... I've only killed some little pious in the ship, that's all.
Bé... Només he matat alguns petits pious del vaixell, això és tot.

Well... No wait, I have something for you but you shouldn't eat it... I'm taking it back to the kitchen.
Bé... No esperem, tinc una cosa per tu però no te l'hauries de menjar... Ho estic portant una altra vegada cap a la cuina.

El teu cervell està yeye ple d'aigua de mar encara, si no pots veure la bellesa d'aquest lloc.

Yeye, it's the logo of the Warrior Guild of Esperia! I wonder what this yoiis was doing so far away from the coast.#0
Yeye, es el logotip de Gremi Guerrer d'Esperia! Hem pregunto què estava fent aquest yoiis tant lluny de la costa.#0
